# Interactive Reading Platform - Product Documentation

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete product specification for an AI-powered interactive reading platform designed to improve children's reading abilities through personalized storytelling. The platform uses artificial intelligence to generate engaging stories that adapt to each child's reading level, interests, and choices.

### Core Concept

The idea originated from a parent's successful experience using AI to help their 9-year-old daughter improve her Hebrew reading skills. By creating interactive stories where the child could influence the narrative direction through choices and questions, the AI became an engaging reading tutor that maintained the child's interest while building essential literacy skills.
