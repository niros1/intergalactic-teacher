## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Family Testing (Week 1-2)
- 3-5 families from personal network
- Hebrew and English speaking families
- Focus on core functionality and story quality
- Daily feedback collection

### Phase 2: Extended Testing (Week 3-4)

3. Is the choice mechanism meaningful and impactful?
4. Are the AI-generated stories age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?
5. Does the reading level adaptation work effectively?

## Technical Constraints for MVP

- Complex gamification elements
- Mobile app development
- Multiple subject areas beyond reading
- Advanced AI personalization algorithms
- Payment processing or subscriptions
- Advanced accessibility features
- Multi-user collaboration features

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Core development and initial testing
- **Week 3-4**: Feature refinement and extended testing  
- **Week 5-6**: Feedback incorporation and final testing
- **Week 7**: Results analysis and next phase planning

## Success Criteria
The MVP will be considered successful if:
- 80% of children complete at least one full story
- 90% of parents rate the experience as educational
- 70% of families express interest in continued use
- Technical issues affect less than 10% of sessions
- Story quality is rated as age-appropriate by 95% of parents
